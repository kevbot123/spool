# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical bug in the CSV import functionality where collections with the same name across different sites can cause cross-site data contamination. When importing CSV data into a collection, the system incorrectly selects collections from other sites if they share the same slug, resulting in content being imported into the wrong site and existing content from other sites being duplicated.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a site administrator, I want CSV imports to only affect collections within my current site, so that my data remains isolated from other sites in the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing CSV data into a collection THEN the system SHALL only query collections that belong to the specified site ID
2. WHEN multiple sites have collections with the same slug THEN the system SHALL only consider the collection from the target site
3. WHEN a collection slug does not exist in the target site THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message indicating the collection was not found in that specific site
4. WHEN the development placeholder site ID is used THEN the system SHALL still enforce site isolation to prevent cross-site contamination

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the collection lookup logic to be consistent across all content operations, so that site isolation is maintained throughout the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any content operation queries collections by slug THEN the system SHALL always include site_id filtering
2. WHEN the development environment is detected THEN the system SHALL use appropriate test data isolation rather than bypassing site filtering entirely
3. WHEN collection queries are performed THEN the system SHALL use consistent patterns that prevent accidental cross-site data access
4. WHEN debugging collection lookup issues THEN error messages SHALL clearly indicate which site was being queried

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ensure data integrity across all sites, so that no site's data can accidentally leak into another site's collections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CSV import operations complete THEN all created content SHALL belong to the correct site as specified in the import request
2. WHEN collection lookups fail THEN the system SHALL fail safely without falling back to collections from other sites
3. WHEN batch content creation occurs THEN all items SHALL be associated with the collection from the correct site only
4. WHEN import errors occur THEN the error messages SHALL clearly indicate the site context and collection availability
