# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Add CORS headers to Spool API routes
  - ✅ Define basic CORS headers with permissive Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
  - ✅ Add CORS headers to all existing Spool API route responses
  - ✅ Handle OPTIONS preflight requests in all API routes
  - ✅ Test that CORS headers are present in API responses
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 1.5_

- [ ] 2. Test CORS fix with localhost development
  - Deploy CORS changes to production
  - Test that localhost:3000 can successfully call www.spoolcms.com API
  - Verify that the original blog post loading issue is resolved
  - Test with different localhost ports (3001, 8000, etc.)
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [ ] 3. Add basic error handling for CORS
  - Ensure proper HTTP status codes for OPTIONS requests
  - Add basic error responses if CORS setup fails
  - Test error scenarios and responses
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.3_

- [ ] 4. Update documentation with CORS information
  - Add note to integration guide about CORS being handled automatically
  - Document that localhost development should work out of the box
  - Add troubleshooting section for any remaining CORS issues
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 5. Optional: Add per-site origin configuration (future enhancement)
  - Add simple origin configuration to site settings if needed later
  - Allow restricting from * to specific origins for security
  - This can be done later if customers request more control
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_
