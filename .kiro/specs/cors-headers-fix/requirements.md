# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Spool CMS production deployment at www.spoolcms.com is currently blocking cross-origin requests from development environments due to missing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) headers. This prevents developers from testing their integrations locally against the production API, which is a critical workflow for headless CMS development. Industry-standard headless CMS products like Contentful, Strapi, and Sanity all support CORS properly to enable local development workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using Spool CMS, I want to test my local development site against the production Spool CMS API, so that I can verify my integration works correctly before deploying.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making requests from localhost:3000 to www.spoolcms.com THEN the requests should not be blocked by CORS policy
2. WHEN making requests from localhost with any port THEN the requests should be allowed for development purposes
3. WHEN making requests from 127.0.0.1 with any port THEN the requests should be allowed for development purposes
4. WHEN making preflight OPTIONS requests THEN they should return appropriate CORS headers
5. WHEN making actual API requests THEN they should include proper CORS headers in the response

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want CORS headers to be configured securely, so that only legitimate development and production origins are allowed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring CORS origins THEN localhost and 127.0.0.1 should be allowed for development
2. WHEN configuring CORS origins THEN production domains should be configurable per site
3. WHEN an unauthorized origin makes a request THEN it should be properly blocked
4. WHEN CORS headers are set THEN they should follow security best practices
5. WHEN credentials are needed THEN CORS should support credentials appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a site owner, I want to configure which domains can access my Spool CMS content, so that I have control over where my content can be consumed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up a site THEN I should be able to specify allowed origins
2. WHEN updating site settings THEN I should be able to modify allowed origins
3. WHEN no origins are specified THEN reasonable defaults should be applied
4. WHEN wildcard origins are used THEN they should be handled securely
5. WHEN multiple origins are specified THEN all should be properly validated

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear error messages when CORS blocks my requests, so that I can quickly identify and fix configuration issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a CORS request is blocked THEN the error message should be clear and actionable
2. WHEN CORS configuration is missing THEN the system should provide helpful guidance
3. WHEN debugging CORS issues THEN relevant headers should be visible in browser dev tools
4. WHEN CORS preflight fails THEN the specific reason should be identifiable
5. WHEN origins are misconfigured THEN clear validation errors should be shown

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want CORS configuration to be manageable and auditable, so that I can maintain security while enabling development workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CORS settings are changed THEN the changes should be logged
2. WHEN reviewing security settings THEN CORS configuration should be easily auditable
3. WHEN deploying to different environments THEN CORS settings should be environment-appropriate
4. WHEN troubleshooting CORS issues THEN logs should provide sufficient information
5. WHEN updating CORS settings THEN changes should take effect immediately
