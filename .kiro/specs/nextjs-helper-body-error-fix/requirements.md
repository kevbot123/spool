# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Currently, Spool CMS forces developers to use client components due to infinite loop issues with server components, which is not standard for headless CMS products. Industry leaders like Contentful, Strapi, and Sanity all work seamlessly with Next.js server components out of the box. To compete with the best headless CMS products, Spool needs to provide reliable server component support that matches industry standards while maintaining backward compatibility with client components for interactive features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using Spool CMS, I want to use server components for content fetching just like other headless CMS products, so that I can follow Next.js best practices and get optimal performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer calls getSpoolContent in a server component THEN it should work without infinite loops or errors
2. WHEN using server components with Spool THEN the behavior should match other headless CMS products like Contentful
3. WHEN fetching content on the server THEN it should use proper request deduplication to prevent multiple identical requests
4. WHEN building static pages THEN server components should work reliably in both development and production environments
5. WHEN using generateStaticParams THEN content fetching should work without issues during build time

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the same API to work in both server and client components, so that I have flexibility in my architecture choices without learning different APIs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using getSpoolContent in a server component THEN it should use the same function signature as client components
2. WHEN switching between server and client components THEN no code changes should be required beyond adding 'use client'
3. WHEN the environment changes from server to client THEN the function should automatically adapt its behavior
4. WHEN using TypeScript THEN the same types should work for both server and client usage
5. WHEN handling errors THEN both server and client components should receive consistent error handling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper request caching and deduplication that works reliably in all Next.js environments, so that I don't experience performance issues or infinite loops.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple components request the same content THEN only one API call should be made per request cycle
2. WHEN using Next.js development mode THEN request deduplication should prevent infinite loops caused by hot reloading
3. WHEN building static pages THEN caching should work correctly during the build process
4. WHEN requests fail THEN the caching system should not cache failed requests indefinitely
5. WHEN using React Strict Mode THEN double rendering should not cause duplicate API calls
6. WHEN the same content is requested multiple times in a short period THEN it should be served from cache

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation and examples showing both server and client component patterns, so that I can choose the right approach for my use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading the integration guide THEN it should show server component examples as the primary approach
2. WHEN looking for client component examples THEN they should be clearly marked as optional for interactive features
3. WHEN following the examples THEN both server and client patterns should work without modification
4. WHEN troubleshooting THEN the guide should explain when to use each approach
5. WHEN migrating from client to server components THEN the guide should provide clear migration steps

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want environment variable handling that works correctly in both server and client contexts, so that I don't need to duplicate configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using server components THEN regular environment variables should work (SPOOL_API_KEY, SPOOL_SITE_ID)
2. WHEN using client components THEN NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefixed variables should work automatically
3. WHEN the function detects its environment THEN it should automatically use the correct environment variables
4. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN clear error messages should indicate which variables are needed
5. WHEN switching between environments THEN the same configuration object should work in both contexts

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Spool CMS to work with Next.js caching and revalidation features, so that I get optimal performance like other headless CMS products.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is updated in Spool admin THEN Next.js pages should revalidate automatically
2. WHEN using fetch with Next.js caching THEN Spool requests should respect Next.js cache settings
3. WHEN using generateStaticParams THEN content should be cached appropriately during build
4. WHEN using revalidatePath THEN Spool content should update correctly
5. WHEN deploying to production THEN caching behavior should be consistent with development
