# Supabase Realtime Live Updates - Requirements

## Introduction

This feature implements industry-standard centralized live updates for Spool CMS using Supabase Realtime. Users will connect directly to Spool's Supabase infrastructure for real-time content updates, similar to how Sanity and Contentful handle live updates. This approach provides enterprise-grade real-time capabilities with minimal user setup.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Centralized Live Updates Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a Spool CMS user, I want my Next.js app to receive real-time content updates automatically, so that I can see changes immediately during development without any complex setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is created, updated, published, or deleted in Spool CMS THEN all connected user apps for that site SHALL receive the update within 1 second
2. WHEN a user installs the Spool Next.js package THEN live updates SHALL work automatically with only their existing Spool API credentials
3. WHEN multiple users are editing different sites simultaneously THEN each user SHALL only receive updates for their own site
4. WHEN a user's app connects to live updates THEN the connection SHALL be authenticated using their Spool API key and site ID
5. WHEN the live updates service is under load THEN it SHALL handle at least 1000 concurrent connections per site

### Requirement 2: Secure Public Credentials Architecture

**User Story:** As a Spool CMS operator, I want to provide public Supabase credentials that are secure and cannot be abused, so that users get seamless live updates without compromising our infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN public Supabase credentials are embedded in the package THEN they SHALL have read-only access to live updates data only
2. WHEN a user connects with invalid Spool credentials THEN they SHALL be denied access to live updates
3. WHEN Row Level Security policies are applied THEN users SHALL only access updates for sites they own (verified by API key)
4. WHEN rate limiting is implemented THEN no single user SHALL be able to make more than 100 connections per minute
5. WHEN monitoring is active THEN unusual connection patterns SHALL trigger alerts within 5 minutes

### Requirement 3: Database Schema for Live Updates

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a dedicated live updates table that stores real-time events efficiently, so that the system can broadcast updates without impacting the main content database performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the live_updates table is created THEN it SHALL store site_id, event_type, collection, slug, item_id, and timestamp
2. WHEN content changes occur THEN an entry SHALL be inserted into live_updates within 100ms
3. WHEN live update entries are older than 1 hour THEN they SHALL be automatically cleaned up
4. WHEN RLS policies are applied THEN users SHALL only see live_updates for sites where they have valid API access
5. WHEN the table is queried THEN it SHALL support efficient filtering by site_id and timestamp

### Requirement 4: Next.js Package Integration

**User Story:** As a Next.js developer, I want the Spool package to handle all live updates connection logic automatically, so that I don't need to write any WebSocket or real-time code myself.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the createSpoolWebhookHandler is configured with developmentConfig THEN it SHALL automatically establish a Supabase Realtime connection
2. WHEN a live update is received THEN it SHALL trigger the same webhook handlers as production webhooks
3. WHEN the connection is lost THEN it SHALL automatically reconnect with exponential backoff
4. WHEN the app is in production mode THEN live updates SHALL be disabled and only webhooks SHALL be used
5. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN it SHALL gracefully fallback without breaking the app

### Requirement 5: Broadcasting System

**User Story:** As a content editor, I want my changes to appear immediately in connected developer environments, so that I can see the impact of my edits in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is modified in the Spool CMS THEN it SHALL broadcast to Supabase Realtime within 200ms
2. WHEN broadcasting occurs THEN it SHALL include event type, collection, slug, item_id, and timestamp
3. WHEN multiple sites are active THEN broadcasts SHALL be isolated by site_id channel
4. WHEN the broadcast fails THEN it SHALL log the error but not impact the content save operation
5. WHEN a broadcast is sent THEN all connected clients for that site SHALL receive it within 1 second

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want live updates to be resilient to network issues and service outages, so that my development workflow isn't disrupted by temporary connectivity problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Supabase connection fails THEN it SHALL retry with exponential backoff up to 5 attempts
2. WHEN credentials are invalid THEN it SHALL log a clear error message and disable live updates gracefully
3. WHEN rate limits are hit THEN it SHALL back off and retry after the rate limit window
4. WHEN the service is unavailable THEN the app SHALL continue to work normally without live updates
5. WHEN connection is restored THEN it SHALL resume live updates automatically without requiring app restart

### Requirement 7: Development Experience

**User Story:** As a developer using Spool CMS, I want clear feedback about the live updates connection status, so that I know when real-time updates are working or if there are issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN live updates connect successfully THEN it SHALL log "[DEV] âœ… Connected to Spool Realtime for site: {siteId}"
2. WHEN a live update is received THEN it SHALL log "[DEV] ðŸ”„ Live update: {collection}/{slug}"
3. WHEN connection fails THEN it SHALL log clear error messages with troubleshooting hints
4. WHEN in production mode THEN it SHALL not log development-specific messages
5. WHEN the revalidate endpoint is missing THEN it SHALL warn the user with setup instructions

### Requirement 8: Security and Compliance

**User Story:** As a Spool CMS operator, I want the live updates system to be secure and compliant with data protection requirements, so that customer data is protected and access is properly controlled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN RLS policies are implemented THEN they SHALL prevent cross-site data access under all conditions
2. WHEN API keys are validated THEN they SHALL be checked against the sites table for ownership
3. WHEN connections are established THEN they SHALL be logged for security monitoring
4. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN it SHALL be automatically blocked and reported
5. WHEN credentials are rotated THEN the system SHALL handle the transition gracefully

### Requirement 9: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As the Spool CMS platform grows, I want the live updates system to scale efficiently, so that performance remains consistent regardless of the number of users or sites.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN 100 concurrent connections are active THEN response time SHALL remain under 100ms
2. WHEN broadcasting to 50 connected clients THEN all clients SHALL receive updates within 2 seconds
3. WHEN the live_updates table grows large THEN query performance SHALL remain consistent through proper indexing
4. WHEN cleanup runs THEN it SHALL remove old entries without impacting active connections
5. WHEN monitoring is active THEN performance metrics SHALL be tracked and alerted on degradation
